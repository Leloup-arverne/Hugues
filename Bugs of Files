I installed the paid version 3.8.0. Since then, there have been frequent bugs, causing the app to stop working. 
I haven't been able to identify what manipulation was causing these stoppages.
It's a pity, because I'd read some interesting articles about this app. 
Could you point me in the right direction?
Thanks in advance.
